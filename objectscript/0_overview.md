# These docs cover the fundamentals of the Objectscript Language. I've include important links I've used to learn these examples.  Most of the examples can be executed via the shell.

# At a basic level, the areas to cover begin with the following topics:
1. Commands
2. Variables.
3. Expressions.
4. Looping

Here's a tutorial type page to get examples of basic language constructs:

# Docker and Server Setup.
1. To run code in IRIS, an IRIS Server is needed.
2. I created a small sample server via the following link: [http://72.14.190.117:52773/csp/sys/%25CSP.Portal.Home.zen?IRISLogout=end](http://72.14.190.117:52773/csp/sys/%25CSP.Portal.Home.zen
4. Login/Pass: dev/dev
5. The System Explorer allows you to see the code base.
6. Use an SSH KEY
